Raith_GDSII Python toolbox
==========================

*Python version in development*


Credit to the [National Institute for Nanotechnology](http://nint-innt.ca) (NINT) for developing, and the University of Alberta [nanoFAB](http://nanofab.ualberta.ca) facility for maintaining the [original Matlab toolbox](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/Raith_GDSII). The bulk of this python toolbox is derived from their work.

---

The four class definitions in this toolbox provide a simple, versatile, and scriptable means of generating patterns for [Raith](http://www.raith.com) electron-beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) tools using [Python](https://www.python.org/).

This complementary python toolbox is being developed by the [Photonics Group](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/photonics/) at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/)

Aims
--------

* Generate Raith-dialect GDSII hierarchy (.csf) and positionlist (.pls) files directly within Python
* Plot patterns in matplotlib using Raith dose factor colouration, from individual GDSII elements to entire positionlists
* Full support for Raith curved elements (circles, ellipses, arcs)  
* Export pattern in plain GDSII (Raith curved elements converted to polygons and paths), to use with non-Raith GDSII editors
